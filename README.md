# Vācējvaboles!!

A basic card game heavily based on the Russian card game "Duraks" / "Дурак", which means fool.

## Before you play:

- Cookies must be enabled. The game only works with cookies - it stores the data of the current game, which position you are playing as, etc.
- Expect bugs, it is a one-person team working on this entire project. (Well, two, if you count the author of the game)
- Have fun, don't take it too seriously. I, in no way, can impact the way you suck at it, so don't go after me for your incompetence.
