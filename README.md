# Vācējvaboles!

A basic card game heavily based on the Russian card game "Duraks" / "Дурак", which means fool.

## Before you play:

- Cookies must be enabled. The game only works with cookies - it stores the data of the current game, which position you are playing as, etc.
- Expect bugs, it is a one-person team working on this entire project. (Well, two, if you count the author of the game)
- Have fun, don't take it too seriously. I, in no way, can impact the way you suck at it, so don't go after me for your incompetence.

## About updates:

I am a student, I will try my best to keep the game maintained and pristine, for you, of course, but if there is any game-breaking issue, please contact me on Discord: _cloud.9._
- There is an update log on the official site and I will explain the changes both here and there.
